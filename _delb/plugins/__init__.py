    By deriving a subclass from this one, a document extension class is registered as
    plugin. These are supposed to add additional attributes to a document, e.g. derived
    data or methods to interact with storage systems. All attributes of an extension
    should share a common prefix that terminates with an underscore, e.g.
    `storage_load`, `storage_save`, etc.

    This base class also acts as termination for methods that can be implemented by
    mixin classes. Any implementation of a method must call a base class' one, e.g.:

    .. code-block::

        Registers a document loader.

        An example module that is specified as ``delb`` plugin for an IPFS loader might
        look like this:

        .. testcode::

            from os import getenv
            from types import SimpleNamespace
            from typing import Any

            from _delb.plugins import plugin_manager
            from _delb.plugins.https_loader import https_loader
            from _delb.typing import LoaderResult


            IPFS_GATEWAY = getenv("IPFS_GATEWAY_PREFIX", "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/")


            @plugin_manager.register_loader()
            def ipfs_loader(source: Any, config: SimpleNamespace) -> LoaderResult:
                if isinstance(source, str) and source.startswith("ipfs://"):

                    config.source_url = source
                    config.ipfs_gateway_source_url = IPFS_GATEWAY + source[7:]

                    return https_loader(config.ipfs_gateway_source_url, config)

                # return an indication why this loader didn't attempt to load in order
                # to support debugging
                return "The input value is not an URL with the ipfs scheme."


        The ``source`` argument is what a :class:`Document` instance is initialized with
        as input data.

        Note that the ``config`` argument that is passed to a loader function contains
        configuration data, it's the :attr:`delb.Document.config` property after
        :meth:`_init_config <_delb.plugins.DocumentMixinHooks._init_config>` has
        been processed.

        Loaders that retrieve a document from an URL should add the origin as string to
        the ``config`` object as ``source_url``.

        You might want to specify a loader to be considered before or after another
        one. Let's assume a loader shall figure out what to load from a remote XML
        resource that contains a reference to the actual document.
        That one would have to be considered before the one that loads XML documents
        from a URL with the `https` scheme:

        .. testcode::

            from _delb.plugins import plugin_manager
